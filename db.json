          "text": "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where computers learn patterns from data to make decisions or predictions without explicit programming. It includes supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning approaches, each serving different purposes. In supervised learning, models learn from labeled data; in unsupervised, they find hidden patterns; and in reinforcement learning, agents learn by receiving rewards or penalties from their environment. Applications range from recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, and financial modeling. The field has exploded in recent years thanks to advances in computational power, big data, and algorithms."

You train a model on this data, and the model learns the relationship between features and price. Once trained, you can feed it a new house’s features and get a predicted price. Algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks are commonly used for this. The key is that the model uses labeled data to learn, making it suitable for regression and classification tasks."

It's widely used in algorithms like Fibonacci series, tree traversals, and divide-and-conquer approaches. While elegant, recursion can be inefficient for large inputs without memoization or iterative optimization. It's essential to understand the problem depth and stack usage when designing recursive functions."

While this directly represents the mathematical definition, it recalculates the same values multiple times. For example, fibonacci(6) calls fibonacci(5) and fibonacci(4), but fibonacci(5) again calls fibonacci(4) and fibonacci(3), repeating work. This leads to exponential time complexity O(2^n). To improve efficiency, memoization stores already computed results, or dynamic programming solves iteratively. This reduces time complexity to linear O(n), making it suitable for larger inputs."

This dramatically speeds up recursive algorithms. It is widely used in dynamic programming problems like knapsack, coin change, and pathfinding in graphs. Understanding this technique is crucial for optimizing recursive solutions."
